# Portfolio Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm

This C++ project focuses on portfolio optimization using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to efficiently allocate assets in a portfolio to maximize returns while considering risk. The genetic algorithm employs evolutionary principles to evolve and refine portfolios over successive generations.

#Features
Genetic Algorithm: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to iteratively improve the composition of investment portfolios.
Objective Function: Maximizes the sharpe ratio or minimize the volatility by finding the best weights.
Data Source: The algorithm is tested and demonstrated using a dataset comprising daily returns of 10 stocks over a period of 254 days. The data is sourced from the top 10 stocks in terms of Market Cap of the SBF120 as of December 2019.
